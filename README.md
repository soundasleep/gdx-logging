# gdx-logging [![](https://jitpack.io/v/soundasleep/gdx-logging.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#soundasleep/gdx-logging)

Simple logging framework for libgdx. This is my first Java library for a long time!

## Getting started

At the moment this is just published direcly using Jitpack and there aren't any versions. Add to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
allprojects {
  repositories {
    // ...
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
```

And then in your dependencies:

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.github.soundasleep:gdx-logging:0.1.3' // or 'main-SNAPSHOT' for the latest build
}
```

Use `gradlew --refresh-dependencies` to force Gradle to pull the latest copy of all your dependencies.

And then to use the library... TODO

## Developing in Eclipse

1. Clone this repository using Git
2. _Import_ > _Existing Gradle Project_ (important â€“ don't just import the root folder)

You can also run `gradlew eclipse` to reset the `.project` and `.classpath` files.
