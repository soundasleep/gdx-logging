## Getting started

At the moment this is just published direcly using Jitpack and there aren't any versions. Add to your `build.gradle`:

allprojects {
  repositories {
    // ...
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
```

And then in your dependencies:

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.github.soundasleep:gdx-logging:main-SNAPSHOT'
